## Password Generator


The password generator is a single, basic webpage formatted with Bootstrap

I utilized Javascript to do the following:

1. Gather the variables - number of characters in length, which type of characters to be used
2. Concatenate lowercase letters with uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters if the appropriate check boxes are selected
3. Randomly assign the characters to a string
4. Write that string to an element on the page with the id of 'result'
